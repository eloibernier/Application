# Northwestern University - Eloi Code Sample
Welcome to my code sample repository, created as part of my application to Northwestern University. This repository highlights my coding skills and experience, with examples in Python and VBA.

## About the Repository
This repository contains a small but meaningful selection of code, curated to showcase my programming abilities. While not exhaustive, these samples reflect my competency and practical approach to solving problems.

## Folder: For Fun
This folder includes a weekend project I worked on for fun! I explored various aspects of my city's bikeshare service to better understand its functionality. This project gave me an opportunity to apply my skills in Python while exploring a real-world problem.

## Additional Contributions
Alongside Python code, Iâ€™ve also included examples of VBA code to demonstrate my versatility with different programming tools.
